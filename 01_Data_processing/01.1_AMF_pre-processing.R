# This code conducts QC for raw sub-daily scale AMF dataset
# The raw AMF dataset is from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SagFhGwxrJMRygiENTWesFhSd64eJSfq
# Output include a series of variables of interest
# For some variables, there may be multiple sub-variables in the dataset, the average of them was used for each unique variable
# All half-hourly data was aggregated to hourly
# The variables were output as in their original units.
# Outputs 5 files, corresponding to the original 5 files
# This code is done. No need to run the second time
