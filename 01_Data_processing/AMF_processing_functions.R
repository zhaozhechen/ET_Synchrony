# These are functions for pre-processing AMF dataset
# 01_AMF_processing.R is the main function which outputs a df of required hourly variables

# Get required variable after QC
# For fine resolution (Hourly or Half-hourly), QC = 0 and QC = 1 were kept
# For coarser resolutions (daily through yearly), QC <=0 were removed
# Input include:
# The exact variable name (which should be the sub-variable name for a variable group)
# df: The data frame for processing, normally the raw AMF dataset
# Coarse: whether the temporal resolution is coarse or fine (sub-daily). This should be a logical value (TRUE or FALSE)

# Since there could be multiple sub-variables for each variable
# This function extracts all sub-variable for the required variable, QC each of them, and get the average of them
# At hourly scale
# Input include:
# key_varname: Part of the variable name, which could be used to uniquely identify the variable
# df: The data frame, which should be the raw AMF dataset before QC
# Coarse: if True, the resolution is daily, if FALSE, the resolution is sub-daily (default: FALSE)
